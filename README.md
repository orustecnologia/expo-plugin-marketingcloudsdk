# Expo-Plugin-Marketingcloudsdk

"Plugin" designed to be compatible with the latest versions(8.0.+) of the Salesforce MarketingCloudSDK.

It was developed as a form of study and research because the SDK does not have a plugin version (react-native-marketingcloudsdk), compatible with versions above 8.0.+.
